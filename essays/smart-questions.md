  When it comes to tackling new challenges in software development, asking for help can be a challenge in and of itself. Nobody wants to feel stupid, and it always feels like everyone else knows more. However, deep down we all know there are some things we just cannot solve on our own. To combat fear of rejection from superior developers and the struggle of a seemingly unsolvable issue, it is of utmost importance that we know how to ask the right questions. How to Ask Questions the Smart Way by Raymond and Moen provides helpful reminders for getting the most learning out of our questions while avoiding the contempt and embarrassment that comes with having our own foresightedness ridiculed.
  
  <a href = "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71591971/how-can-i-fix-the-zsh-command-not-found-python-error-macos-monterey-12-3">This</a> question from Stack Overflow asks for help running Python code in their Terminal following an OS update. The poster explains the background behind what changes they have made that could have caused the error, including the OS update version, IDE package settings, their attempts at testing the error, and possible theories. In the headline, the poster includes the error and their system conditions, which make it easy for people with similar systems to suggest solutions. The poster also includes a list of fixes they have attempted, including sources for where they found each possible solution. As a result, responders could clearly understand what the problem was and identify solutions that worked for them that the poster had not already tried. After finding a solution that worked, the poster updated their thread with the steps they used. 
 
  <a href = "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38192732/what-is-wrong-with-this-makefile-function">This</a> question from Stack Overflow asks for help understanding their makefile functions. The poster posts two samples of code and claims that one works while the other doesn’t, and that they should ideally produce the same result. The poster’s headline does not specify anything about the problem itself (“What is wrong with this makefile function?”) and provides little context for what the code should be doing. As a result responders have difficulty understanding where the issue is. Though a responder provided a solution that worked, the responder had to state that the poster did not provide enough information for the error to be reproduced, and that the suggested solution was just a guess. This is inefficient for both the poster and the responder, as the responder cannot isolate possible problem areas and the poster is not learning where this solution came from or how to avoid it in the future.
	
   Though I try to keep my questions specific, relevant, and clear, I am sometimes guilty of asking the not-so-smart question. When it comes to software engineering, time and energy are both of the essence. We should be grateful to those who are willing to help us for free, and make sure that their goodwill is made productive. Seeing the results of the two approaches is another reminder to keep my questions smart, for both the sake of the person I am asking and for the efficiency and quality of my own learning.
