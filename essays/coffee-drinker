Prior to our class, I did not know much about JavaScript besides the fact that it is used for website development to create and edit features. Based on the name I expected it to be similar to Java, in that it would be object-oriented and use similar syntax. I have had experience with other languages such as Python, Java, and C, but I have never implemented those languages with the goal of developing websites so I was not sure what to expect in that aspect. I have used HTML and CSS for very basic website features, so I was excited to learn JavaScript and be able to enhance my skills by integrating the three pieces of code. 

When I think back on my programming experience, most of it so far has leant towards data analysis and visualization. However, I am of the opinion that learning one language makes it exponentially easier to learn more, so for me comparing JavaScript to other languages makes it easier to pick up on syntax and conceptualize data structures. In addition to JavaScript I am also currently learning Dart, which I find similar to the point of getting their features confused. As I build more projects and experience with both I hope to develop increased confidence in them as well. 

With experience using other languages, I felt that JavaScript was easy to pick up and the short snippets of practice helped reinforce my understanding of syntax and basic structures. The ES6 introduction was more difficult for me as it contained concepts I was not formerly familiar with, such as destructuring assignment and promises. I felt interested and yet daunted with the prospect of implementing these in my own projects.

Another new challenge was athletic software engineering, for which this class is my first experience. I don’t force myself to work if I don’t want to, and I like to take my time to create quality work, so the idea of training to code quickly was not appealing to me. The time limit posed a unique challenge – I think that it is something that I will eventually struggle with, as I prefer to take my time while coding. However, I consider myself a competitive person and these challenges are a good opportunity to push myself and develop my skills.
