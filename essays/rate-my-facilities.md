## Overview

Many students on campus have trouble finding clean facilities. It can be uncomfortable to use a restroom that is often out of toilet paper or has long lines. Likewise, filter status of all water dispensers on campus is not equal. We propose a webite that will display a map of facilities (restroom, water fountain, microwave, study spaces/labs, etc) and allow users to rate them and leave comments on their status. The website will also provide information like real-time updates to facilities, foot traffic to the area, and other helpful details.

## Mockup page ideas

- Landing - map of campus, can filter map by facility type
- User homepage
- Facility ranking - sort by traffic, overall ranking, toilet paper stock, water temperature, etc
- Individual facility page - leave comments
- Submit complaints page

## User roles

- Each student has their own account to rate and browse facilities
- Admin role mediates comments and ratings

## Use case ideas

- Users look for nearby facilities
- Users can rate facilities and leave helpful comments
- Users will be alerted if any facility is unable to be used or experiencing a shutdown

## Beyond the basics

- Individual users will be able to rate facilities and view an average of other users' ratings
- Individual users will be able to leave comments on facility pages
- Individual users will be able to save the location of favorited facilities
