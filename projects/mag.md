From Fall 2022, I served as the PR Officer for Manoa Academy of Gamers. As the PR Officer, I manage social media communications for the club in channels such as Discord, Instagram, and Twitter. I write and post reminders and updates regarding club meetings, special events, and other important notifications. 

I also create both print and digital flyers to advertise our events. These flyers are posted to our social media accounts, printed and posted around campus, or printed as other promotional material. I create these graphics using software such as Adobe Photoshop or Canva. 

As the PR Officer, I also communicate with sponsors and external groups that the club is in communication with by attending meetings and participating in sponsor-hosted events. I help to plan and host our club events, take pictures, and create other ways to advertise our club.
