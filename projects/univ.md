summary: "Designing lesson plans and teaching a course dedicated to helping incoming freshmen acclimate to UH Manoa and university life."
---

In the first year of college, students may struggle with being away from home, managing time and money, taking advantage of school resources, and making friends. University Experience (UNIV 110) is a course taught at UH Manoa aimed towards helping freshmen acclimate to the university environment. It is led by an undergraduate peer mentor rather than a professor, so students are able to develop both rapport within the class and one-on-one with the student mentor. I have had the pleasure of leading a UNIV 110 section every Fall semester since 2021.

As a mentor, I construct each lesson's discussion and activities based on our textbook, meet with students one-on-one three times each over the course of the semester, and host fun activities for class bonding outside of class time. I also grade homework, connect students to resources, and support them in their individual goals across the semester and beyond.
